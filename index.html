                    <p>Sleeping Bear Sand Dunes National Lakeshore is located in the northwest part of Michigan's lower peninsula. Voted most beautiful place in America in 2011, I have visited only 5 times in my life, despite growing up only an hour away. According to legend, the big dune covers the body of a sleeping mother bear, who is waiting for her cubs to swim ashore. The cubs, forever unable to join her, are off shore in the form of the North Manitou and South Manitou islands.

                <p>Mindo, Ecuador is located several hours by bus north and west of Ecuador's capital - Quito. A small, quiet town filled with hostals and hummingbirds, it is the perfect escape from the busy city. Eco-tourism options abound, ziplining, tubing on the river, waterfalls and butterfly gardens easily fill the day. Tiny, itching bug bites guaranteed - plus fun. Lots of fun.

                    <p> My temporary home during the southern winter of 2009, Cartagena presented as a colorful and peaceful city. Filled with visitors during the summer, Playa Grande stretches 1800 meters, dotted with small stands that pop up each weekend, selling trinkets and delicious churros.

                    <p> There is no part of getting to Orcas Island or experience on the island that disappoints. Whale watching, fun stores, great people, and a fabulous state park at the center quickly fill the hours leaving you wondering where all the time went!
